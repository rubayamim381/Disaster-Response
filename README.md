Our goal is to be aware of risks of natural disasters and respond to them fast and efficiently . We aim to create a tool to help the people who help others , enabling volunteers to respond fast and efficiently to nearby crisis. Specially during disaster .

## How it works
The website uses Nasa's EONET API and a few other tools to find the natural disasters happening around the globe. And where ever there is a disaster there is a need for help. Volunteers nearby gets informed of the disaster to swiftly appear at site with help.

They can validate the crisis and create a list for the needs for the relief operation . That other volunteers can help with. Lets take a real life example. 
Imagine in your city a flood has caused mass damage and public suffering . Your community now needs 100litres of clean water , 80kg of food , 3 types of medicine for waterborne diseases and transportation like boats for rescuing people and transport some people like an lady to the hospital. 
Lets say a volunteer team arrives only with 100kg of food , the next team comes with 100 kg of more food and so on follows, you realise that you have resources but not the right kind nor of the right amount.
Our platform solves this issue , as the first volunteers fills up everyone on the needs via our platform the following that criteria , govt can gain a better understanding in shorter time of necessary relief efforts , and the the warning beforehand to the volunteers means shorter response.
Put it short , it means help that comes faster , more efficient and where its needed the most.

## Technical parts

We are using geo-data , NASA's EONET API for finding out the disasters as they hit in near real time . A website provides a unified platform for every govt and non-govt personal on the rescue and relief missions more cohesiveness and efficiency .
